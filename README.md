# What is an Axion

> The axion is a hypothetical elementary particle postulated by the Peccei–Quinn theory to resolve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

<br />

> If axions exist and have low mass within a specific range, they are of interest as a possible component of cold dark matter.

<br />

> It is named after a laundry detergent, because it was postulated to remove a stain in the beauty of the theory.


# CP symmetry

> CP-symmetry states that the laws of physics should be the same if a particle were interchanged with its antiparticle (C symmetry, as charges of antiparticles are the negative of the corresponding particle), and then left and right were swapped (P symmetry).


# Strong CP problem

<br />

$$
{\mathcal L}_\mathrm{QCD} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}-\frac{n_f g^2\theta}{32\pi^2}
F_{\mu\nu}\tilde F^{\mu\nu}+\bar \psi(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m
e^{i\theta'\gamma_5})\psi
$$

<br />

* Contains a CP symmetry violating term:

$$
- \frac{n_f g^2\theta}{32\pi^2}
F_{\mu\nu}\tilde F^{\mu\nu}
$$



# Strong CP problem
## Neutron electric dipole moment

* CP symmetry violation leads to a electric dipole moment for the neutron
* So far not measured and can only be very tiny
* Therefore $\theta < 10^{-10} radians$ has to be tiny as well
* Poses a "naturalness" problem

 
# Strong CP problem
##  Massless quarks?

* One massless quark would render CP violation unobservable
* But empirical evidence strongly suggest that none of the quarks are massless


# Peccei–Quinn mechanism

* Promote $\theta$ parameter to a dynamic field instead of a constant
* The potential of this field naturally cancels its value  
* $\theta$ becomes zero uneventfully 

# Axion field

* $\theta$ as a global $U(1)$ symmetry under which a complex scalar field is charged
* This symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value obtained by this scalar field
* Axion arises as massless Nambu-Goldstone boson of this broken symmetry

However: 
* Peccei–Quinn symmetry is inexact
