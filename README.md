# What is an Axion

> The axion is a hypothetical elementary particle postulated by the Peccei–Quinn theory to resolve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).



> If axions exist and have low mass within a specific range, they are of interest as a possible component of cold dark matter.

# CP symmetry

> CP-symmetry states that the laws of physics should be the same if a particle were interchanged with its antiparticle (C symmetry, as charges of antiparticles are the negative of the corresponding particle), and then left and right were swapped (P symmetry).

# Quantum chromodynamics

## Lagrangian

$$ 
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{QCD}(q, A) = \bar{q} (i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m) q + g \bar{q} \gamma^\mu T_a  A^a_\mu q- \frac{1}{4}F^a_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu}_a 
 $$

 with $\lim_{m\to 0}$ : 

$$
\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{QCD}(q, A) = \bar{q} i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu q + g \bar{q} \gamma^\mu T_a  A^a_\mu q- \frac{1}{4}F^a_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu}_a 
$$
