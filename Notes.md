# What is an Axion

> The axion is a hypothetical elementary particle postulated by the Peccei–Quinn theory to resolve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).

<br />

> If axions exist and have low mass within a specific range, they are of interest as a possible component of cold dark matter.

# CP symmetry

> CP-symmetry states that the laws of physics should be the same if a particle were interchanged with its antiparticle (C symmetry, as charges of antiparticles are the negative of the corresponding particle), and then left and right were swapped (P symmetry).

# Strong CP problem

This is the Lagrangian density of quantumchromodynamics.

Quantumchromodynamics is the quantum field theory of the strong interaction concerned with quarks, gluons and their color charge.

As shown by Gerard 't Hooft the Lagrangian density includes a potentially CP symmetry violating term due to its non-trivial vacuum structure.

Combined with effects generated by weak interactions, this effective periodic term, Θ (theta), appears as a Standard Model input, which means that its value is not predicted by the theory and must thus be measured.

## Neutron electric dipole moment

However, large CP-violating interactions originating from QCD would induce a large electric dipole moment (EDM) for the neutron.

Experimental constraints on the currently unobserved EDM implies CP violation from QCD must be extremely tiny and thus Θ must itself be extremely small.

The current limit on the nEDM constrains this angle to be less than 10−10 radians.

Since Θ could have any value between 0 and 2π, this presents a “naturalness” problem for the standard model. 

Why should this parameter find itself so close to zero? 
Or, why should QCD find itself CP-preserving?) 

This question constitutes what is known as the strong CP problem.

# Strong CP problem
## Massless quarks

One simple solution exists: If at least one of the quarks of the standard model is massless, CP symmetry violation becomes unobservable. 

However, empirical evidence strongly suggests that none of the quarks are massless. 

Consequently, particle theorists sought other resolutions to the problem of inexplicably conserved CP.


# Peccei–Quinn mechanism

Peccei–Quinn theory predicts that the small value of the θ parameter is explained by a dynamic field, rather than a constant value. Because particles arise within quantum fields, Peccei–Quinn theory predicts the existence of a new particle, the axion. The potential which this field carries causes it to have a value which naturally cancels, making the θ parameter uneventfully zero.


# Axion field

Peccei–Quinn symmetry presents θ as a functional component – a global U(1) symmetry under which a complex scalar field is charged. This symmetry is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value obtained by this scalar field, and the axion is the massless Goldstone boson of this broken symmetry.

This Peccei–Quinn symmetry is inexact because it is anomalously broken by QCD instantons: If there is a compensatory term canceling the QCD anomaly breaking term, the axion becomes an exactly massless Goldstone boson and θ is no longer fixed. The effective potential of the axion is the summed potential above the QCD scale; with the potential term induced by nonperturbative QCD effects.

If the axion is fundamental, or emerges at a scale far higher than the QCD scale, then the dimension 5 axion coupling term {\displaystyle a\operatorname {Tr} [F\wedge F]}{\displaystyle a\operatorname {Tr} [F\wedge F]} is suppressed by {\displaystyle 1/\Lambda }1/\Lambda  where {\displaystyle \Lambda }\Lambda  is the scale of the axion. Because of this, in order for θ to be so small at the minimum of the effective potential, the bare potential has to be many orders of magnitude smaller than the instanton induced potential, compounded by the {\displaystyle \Lambda }\Lambda  factor. This requires quite a bit of reconciliation with an approximate global symmetry, for which there is no current explanation.
